# mlflow-server

All changes pushed to the `main` branch will execute a github-job to build and push a new image to [DockerHub Repo](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/saumyabhatt106/mlflow-server/general)

**NOTE**

1. Provide the necessary data in the `.env` file before running the server. A sample ``.env file's content is as follows:
2. It is necessary to store the logs and user details in different databases for the MLFlow-Server to run correctly. This is a known [issue](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/10052)

```txt
# Sample .env file contents

# This is where the logs and runs will be stored
DB_USER=user
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_DATABASE=mlflowdb
DB_HOST=host.docker.internal
DB_PORT=5431

# This is where the user related data and permissions are stored
AUTH_DB_USER=user
AUTH_DB_PASSWORD=password
AUTH_DB_DATABASE=mlflowuser
AUTH_DB_HOST=host.docker.internal
AUTH_DB_PORT=5431

# This is where artifacts are stored
AWS_S3_URI=http://192.168.4.211:9000
AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=bucket
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=minio_user
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=minio_password
```

## Setup and Running locally

1. Run the below given command to run ml-flow server locally.

```bash
docker run -d -p 5001:5000 --name mlflow-server --env-file .env saumyabhatt106/mlflow-server
```

The ML-Flow UI would be available at `http://localhost:5001`

### Note

One can locally setup the postgres and the S3 storage (using MinIO) using docker. Run the below commands to set it up:

```bash
docker compose -f ./create.compose.yml up -d
```

## Authorisation and Authentication

1. When accessing the server, one would first encounter a log-in prompt.
2. For new users, contact the admin to create an account for yourself before logging in.
3. The admin will create a username and password for yourself. This combo will be used for:
    1. Logging in to the ML-flow UI
    2. Tagging your experiments and runs.
  
## Tagging Experiments and Runs

* Tag your experiments otherwise anyone could delete/modify it from the UI.*
* Admin has the privileges to access/modify any experiments and runs. Rest all can only view otherâ€™s experiments and runs.*

```python
os.environ['MLFLOW_TRACKING_USERNAME'] = "saumi"
os.environ['MLFLOW_TRACKING_PASSWORD'] = "1234"

mlflow.create_experiment('2W_ahmedabad')
mlflow.set_tracking_uri('http://localhost:5000')
```
